# find-my-face
A basic Artificial Intelligence (AI) project for live video face detection using OpenCV (`cv2`) and Cascade Classifier for front face of humans.
The project is a base to perform operations on Face Detection using HAAR Cascade Classifier. The code draws a rectangle around an human face it detects through the primary webcam attached to the machine. It can be built futher to use remote camera or IP Camera to detect number of people and further classify them into a group or a crowd.
