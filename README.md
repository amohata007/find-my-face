# find-my-face

## Introduction 
A basic Artificial Intelligence (AI) project for live video face detection using OpenCV (`cv2`) and Cascade Classifier for Front Face of humans.
The project is a base to perform operations on Face Detection using HAAR Cascade Classifier. The code draws a rectangle around an human face it detects through the primary webcam attached to the machine.
## Further Updates 
It will be built further to use remote camera or IP Camera to detect number of people and further classify them into a group or a crowd.
Moreover the files will be added here in this repository as and when released.

## Changelog
* **15.12.2018**<br> Added basic live video module which uses primary webcam of the machine and detects single human face in it using `Python3` and OpenCV.
* **16.12.2018**:<br> Added Face Detection through [IP Webcam](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam&hl=en_IN) app for Android© (v4.0 and above), can capture the footage remotely via an Android© device   connected to the same network on [IP Webcam](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam&hl=en_IN) app.
